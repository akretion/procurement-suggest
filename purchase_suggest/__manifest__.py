Purchase Suggest
================

This module is an ALTERNATIVE to the module *procurement_suggest* ; it is similar but it only handles the purchase orders and doesn't generate any procurement : the suggestions create a new purchase order directly.

The advantage is that you are not impacted by the faulty procurements (for example :  a procurement generates a PO ; the PO is confirmed ; the related picking is cancelled and deleted -> the procurements will always stay in running without related stock moves !)

To use this module, you need to apply the patch *odoo-purchase_suggest.patch* on the source code of Odoo.

You may want to increase the osv_memory_age_limit (default value = 1h) in Odoo server config file, in order to let some time to the purchase user to finish his work on the purchase suggestions.
